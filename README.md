# exercise-00_patterning

**Project:** The intention of this exercise is to begin to explore the generative capabilities of Rhinoceros with Python Script through the development of a 2D patterning system. Using Python Script, design a system (code) that generates a progressively variable pattern that produces emergent to effects divergent (shits, scaling, morphing, apparently random...) in a field aggregation. Demonstrate variation in the system through representing sequential states.

This exercise has been broken into 3 parts, each building and expanding upon the knowledge of the previous. You are essentially asked to do and redo the same assignment 3 times, expanding on the possibilities and complexities of your designed patterning system.

**Reading/Reference:** RhinoPythonPrimer: Variable Data (p 4-10), Looping (p 27-31), Tuples and Lists (p. 32-34), Operators and Functions (p 15-26), Dictionaries (p 35), “Pattern Recognition,” Mario Carpo

**Deliverables:**
- Upload script(s)
- Upload (at minimum) 10 sequential still images demonstrating the capability of the system for variability. Images should be line drawings output to illustrator and compiled into a single pdf.
- Upload 20 second MP4 animation of pattern(s) @ (1600 x 800) resolution + original script(s) used to produce it.

All materials should be uploaded to their respective folders in this repository.
